
ROTATING Axis Aligned Bounding Boxes COLLISION BREAKDOWN
- how to collide rectangles at any angle
- no longer rectangle, they are 4 lines
- find equation of each line for each rectangle (math 10 time)
- find intersection points of all lines
- if intersection point is within the bounds of one of the rectangles, they are colliding 



keylistener only checks when keys go down/up, we need to keep track of button states ourselves if we want multiple at once

ez fix, format files to be consistent, noticed imports in systems files
